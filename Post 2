<p>Hot flashes can be a common discomfort during menopause, but a new study suggests that dietary changes may offer relief.Researchers found that a low fat, plant-based diet rich in soy products was as effective as hormone replacement therapy for reducing hot flashes.Participants who followed the dietary protocol also experienced weight loss.The results suggest a potential for dietary changes as a first-line treatment for hot flashes.More research is still needed to understand the role of diet on hot flashes and other menopause-related symptoms.Making dietary changes during menopause may be as effective as hormone replacement therapy for treating hot flashes without associated health risks.That’s according to a new study recently published in the journal Menopause by the North American Menopause Society.According to researchers, participants who adhered to a strictly plant-based diet rich in soy saw an 88% reduction in their symptoms. By comparison, hormone replacement therapy is associated with a 70–90% reduction in hot flashes.In addition, participants also reduced total weight by 8 pounds on average over 12 weeks.“Our results mirror the diets of places in the world, like pre-Westernized Japan and modern-day Yucatán Peninsula, where a low fat, plant-based diet including soybeans is more prevalent and where postmenopausal women experience fewer symptoms,” said lead researcher Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, and adjunct professor at the George Washington University School of Medicine in a news release.</p>

<p>But last week, people who menstruate got a rare piece of good news.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cvshealth.com/womens-health" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CVS announced</a>&nbsp;it would lower prices on CVS Health and Live Better tampons, menstrual pads, liners, and cups on Oct. 13.</p>

<p>CVS is also now paying the sales taxes on menstrual products in 12 states: Arkansas, Georgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Missouri, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin, and West Virginia.</p>

<p>CVS cannot assume the taxes in other states that charge them because of laws that do not allow third-parties to take care of the tax for customers. One physician applauded the decision.</p>

<p>“Another step toward acknowledging how vital these products are to people who menstruate,” says Dr.&nbsp;<a href="https://drcurrywinchell.com/meet-dr-bcw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bayo Curry-Winchell</a>, a physician, TEDx speaker, and founder of Beyond Clinical Walls.</p>

<p>Curry-Winchell and other providers and advocates discussed the significance of CVS’ announcement and the importance of addressing period poverty, particularly in a world struggling to recover from the economic strains brought on by the pandemic and mounting inflation.</p>
